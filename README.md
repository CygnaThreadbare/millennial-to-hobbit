millennial-to-hobbit (WIP)
=============

Chrome extension that replaces occurrences of 'millennial' with 'hobbit'

Forked from https://github.com/panicsteve/cloud-to-butt

Also works in Vivaldi and should work in most Chromium-based browsers.

The idea was taken from [this Twitter thread](https://twitter.com/CryptTrash/status/1055694121447370752).

Installation
------------

Download and extract the [last version zip file](https://github.com/CygnaThreadbare/millennial-to-hobbit/releases/download/v1.0/millennial-to-hobbit-1.0.zip) from the releases page.

In Chrome, choose More Tools > Extensions. Or either type chrome://extensions/ in the address bar.

Click in the "Developer mode" button to allow loading unpacked extensions.

In the following window, click the "load unpacked" button and select the directory where you've extracted the extension.

In the near future I expect to publish it to the Chrome Web Store to avoid these manual steps.
